What if a failure happens in recv or send function?
Solved: We throw an exception, and catch it in the topper level.
        We have Basic Guarantee, failure in sending/receiving will result in failure request to webpage
        or response to client. But all invariants are preserved and there are no resources or memory leaks.
        The client sockets structure will be freed when out of bound by calling destructor.
        Any responses stored in cache will be still there and keep unchanged.

What if other exceptions or failure signal happens and terminates the program?
Solved: We use signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN) in our program, just ignores a given signal and keeps the proxy running.

Some websites are loaded very slowly, and CSS style cannot be received.
Solved: Proxy receives the part of the response from server and we let it send this part to the client at
        the same time. The loading speed becomes quicker and CSS now can be received.

2021.3.2 
What if we receive a bad request from client, which didn't include GET, POST, CONNECT?
Solved: We return a 400 Bad Request response to client.

2021.3.3
What if we receive a bad response from server?
Solved: We check if it includes "\r\n\r\n", if not, we return a 502 Bad Gateway response.

2021.3.5
What if there are too many threads and they affect the efficiency?
To be solved: We could use thread pool in the future.

2021.3.9
When a response from a website is not perfect, and it is cached, then user has no chance to request a new one.
To be solved: Need a strategy to juedge whether the response from the server is perfect.
